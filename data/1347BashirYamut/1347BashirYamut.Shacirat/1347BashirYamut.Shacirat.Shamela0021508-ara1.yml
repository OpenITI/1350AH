90#VERS#COMMENT##: Although the edition I used for collation is exactly the same
    as the edition of the digital version and the pages are the same, the digital
    version contains extra information that does not appear in the PDF. There is a
    short biographical section entitled (“ترجمتها”) at the beginning of most names
    that does not exist in the PDF. The sub-header “المناسبة” does not exist in the
    PDF either and the information in this part is sometimes more detailed in
    comparison with what is written in the PDF (I tagged these two subsections as
    “#~:section:”). The digital version also contains extra entries that do not
    exist in the PDF. It seems that the producer of the digital version has added
    more information about each poet (or maybe the information in the METADATA is
    wrong and the version is based on a newer edition). The information is valuable
    anyway. I don’t think we need to do anything about it. 2- The numbers are
    checked by Peter’s script.
    All paratextual elements
    (introductions, footnotes, indices, ...)
