90#VERS#COMMENT##: Shia000814Vols is a digitization of (a pirated edition of?)
    ʿAlī Yaḥyā al-Yamānī's edition of the Sharḥ al-Azhār (Cairo 1332: Maṭbaʿat
    Sharikat al-Tamaddun),
    which includes Ibn ʿAbd Allāh Jundārī's Tarājim al-rijāl al-madhkūra fī
    Sharḥ al-Azhār
    (in the introduction to volume 1) and al-Ḥīmī's Tabṣira (in appendix to vol.
    3).
    Additionally, the edition contains ḥawāshī in the footnotes, which,
    according to the title page,
    came from a manuscript (dated 1207 AH) that was copied (including the
    ḥawāshī)
    from a manuscript of and read to Shaykh al-Islām al-qāḍī al-ʿallāma
    Muḥammad b. ʿAlī al-Shawkānī.
    The text was split into its constituent parts by PV.
    The ḥawāshī were also split off into a separate file.
    All paratextual elements
