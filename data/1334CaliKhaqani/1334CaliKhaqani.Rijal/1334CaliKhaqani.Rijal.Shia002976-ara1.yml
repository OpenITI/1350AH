90#VERS#ANNOTATOR: HRH, PV
90#VERS#COMMENT##: HRH added structural annotation.
        PV made the 16 sections on the 16 fawā'id
        subsections of the first part of the book
        (based on the description of the book and the author's method
        in the editor's introduction, p. 16-20)
        removed the editorial sections,
        and added descriptive titles (taken from the editor's comments)
        between square brackets to the start of the two main parts
        of the book (pp. 1, 209).
    All paratextual elements
    (introductions, footnotes, indices, ...)
    removed by HRH and MGR (OpenITI Clean operation, 2023)
