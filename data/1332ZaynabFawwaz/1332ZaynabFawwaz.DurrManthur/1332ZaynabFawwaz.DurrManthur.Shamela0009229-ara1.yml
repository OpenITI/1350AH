90#VERS#ANNOTATOR: HRH
90#VERS#COMMENT##: The introduction by the original author (pages 5-16) in which she describes her methodology and presents other information is missing in the digital version and the digital version begins with the names. I think this part must be considered a missing part since it is written by the original author. The typist has intentionally left this part out most probably because the main theme of the book is biography. A typed version of the whole text including the introduction can be found here: https://ia601004.us.archive.org/29/items/azm101010_gmail_20180410_1837/%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%AF%D8%B1_%D8%A7%D9%84%D9%85%D9%86%D8%AB%D9%88%D8%B1_%D9%81%D9%8A_%D8%B7%D8%A8%D9%82%D8%A7%D8%AA_%D8%B1%D8%A8%D8%A7%D8%AA_%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%AE%D8%AF%D9%88%D8%B1.pdf
